# ecs-system
I heard of ECS, or Entity Component System, a year ago from a colleague at Gameloft. The idea of a different style of programming that is different from OOP and performs better nonetheless all seems novel to me. I've always wanted to build one for my own usage and experience. 

Huge thanks and appreciation to [Austin Morlan's post on ECS](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/) that gives me a huge inspiration and understanding of ECS. The ECS system I built is hugely based on Austin's post.
